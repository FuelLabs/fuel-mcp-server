## _Icon Link_ [Contract](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-rs/glossary/\#contract)

A contract, in the SDK, is an abstraction that represents a connection to a specific smart contract deployed on the Fuel Network. This contract instance can be used as a regular Rust object, with methods attached to it that reflect those in its smart contract equivalent.

## _Icon Link_ [Provider](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-rs/glossary/\#provider)

A Provider is a struct that provides an abstraction for a connection to a Fuel node. It provides read-only access to the node. You can use this provider as-is or through the wallet.
