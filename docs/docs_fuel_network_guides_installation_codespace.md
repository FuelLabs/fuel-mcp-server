## _Icon Link_ [Introduction](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/codespace/\#introduction)

The way to think about [Github Codespaces _Icon Link_](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is essentially VSCode in a browser. It‚Äôs a remote development environment that is extremely easy to spin up. While not all VS Code plugins are supported, the Sway LSP plugin is supported and works out of the box.

## _Icon Link_ [How to set up for a new repo](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/codespace/\#how-to-set-up-for-a-new-repo)

1. Create a `devcontainer.json` file. The easiest way is by navigating to the repo and clicking Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Configure dev container

2. Edit the file to include the following features:







```fuel_Box fuel_Box-idXKMmm-css
"features": {
       "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:1": {},
       "ghcr.io/FuelLabs/devcontainer-features/fuelup:1.0.1": {},
}
```

3. Add any plugins that you want to be installed for this repo under ‚Äúcustomizations‚Äù.







```fuel_Box fuel_Box-idXKMmm-css
"customizations": {
       "vscode": {
           "extensions": [\
               "fuellabs.sway-vscode-plugin"\
           ]
       }
}

3. This will open a new tab with your codespace. It can take several minutes to start up.

    3.1. You now have a fully functional remote development environment with the Fuel toolchain installed! You can use `forc` to build and deploy Sway code, or `fuelup` to manage the toolchain version. You also have the Sway LSP plugin with full feature support for Sway, like syntax highlighting, hover docs, go-to definitions, etc.

    3.2. Note: if you are working on a large repository and find the codespace is running slow, you can configure it to use a larger instance by clicking Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí change machine type on a running instance, or starting a new instance with Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí New with options.
