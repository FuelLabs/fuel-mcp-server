Sway Libs

## _Icon Link_ [Sway Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#sway-libraries)

The purpose of Sway Libraries is to contain libraries which users can import and use that are not part of the standard library.

There are several types of libraries that Sway Libs encompasses. These include libraries that provide convenience functions, [Sway-Standards _Icon Link_](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards) supporting libraries, data type libraries, security functionality libraries, and other tools valuable to blockchain development.

For implementation details on the libraries please see the [Sway Libs Docs _Icon Link_](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-libs/master/sway_libs/).

## _Icon Link_ [Assets Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#assets-libraries)

Asset Libraries are any libraries that use [Native Assets _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets) on the Fuel Network.

## _Icon Link_ [Asset Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#asset-library)

The [Asset](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/asset/) Library provides helper functions for the [SRC-20 _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-20-native-asset/), [SRC-3 _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-3-minting-and-burning/), and [SRC-7 _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-7-asset-metadata/) standards.

## _Icon Link_ [Access Control and Security Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#access-control-and-security-libraries)

Access Control and Security Libraries are any libraries that are built and intended to provide additional safety when developing smart contracts.

## _Icon Link_ [Ownership Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#ownership-library)

The [Ownership](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/ownership/) Library is used to apply restrictions on functions such that only a **single** user may call them.

## _Icon Link_ [Admin Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#admin-library)

The [Admin](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/admin/) Library is used to apply restrictions on functions such that only a select few users may call them like a whitelist.

## _Icon Link_ [Pausable Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#pausable-library)

The [Pausable](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/pausable/) Library allows contracts to implement an emergency stop mechanism.

## _Icon Link_ [Reentrancy Guard Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#reentrancy-guard-library)

The [Reentrancy Guard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/reentrancy/) Library is used to detect and prevent reentrancy attacks.

## _Icon Link_ [Cryptography Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#cryptography-libraries)

Cryptography Libraries are any libraries that provided cryptographic functionality beyond what the std-lib provides.

## _Icon Link_ [Bytecode Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#bytecode-library)

The [Bytecode](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/bytecode/) Library is used for on-chain verification and computation of bytecode roots for contracts and predicates.

## _Icon Link_ [Merkle Library](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#merkle-library)

The [Merkle Proof](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/merkle/) Library is used to verify Binary Merkle Trees computed off-chain.

## _Icon Link_ [Math Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#math-libraries)

Math Libraries are libraries which provide mathematic functions or number types that are outside of the std-lib's scope.

## _Icon Link_ [Signed Integers](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#signed-integers)

The [Signed Integers](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/signed_integers/) Library is an interface to implement signed integers.

## _Icon Link_ [Data Structures Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#data-structures-libraries)

Data Structure Libraries are libraries which provide complex data structures which unlock additional functionality for Smart Contracts.

## _Icon Link_ [Queue](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#queue)

The [Queue](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/queue/) Library is a linear data structure that provides First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations.

## _Icon Link_ [Upgradability Libraries](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#upgradability-libraries)

Upgradability Libraries are libraries which provide functions to implement contract upgrades.

## _Icon Link_ [Upgradability](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway-libs/\#upgradability)

The [Upgradability](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/upgradability/) Library provides functions that can be used to implement contract upgrades via simple upgradable proxies.
