## _Icon Link_ [Fraud Proof](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#fraud-proof)

Fraud proofs are a blockchain verification mechanism whereby a claim on a new block is accepted unless a proof the claim is invalid is provided within some configurable time window. Both the Fuel protocol and the FuelVM are designed to be fraud-provable in restrictive environments such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## _Icon Link_ [Locked Wallet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#locked-wallet)

A locked wallet is a wallet that can only interact with read-only smart contract methods.

## _Icon Link_ [Mainnet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#mainnet)

Mainnet refers to the main network of a blockchain, as opposed to a testnet.

## _Icon Link_ [Merkle Tree](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#merkle-tree)

A Merkle tree is a data structure which uses a cryptographic hash function recursively to condense a set of data into a single value, called the root. It allows efficient proofs that a given element is part of the set.

## _Icon Link_ [Native Asset](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#native-asset)

With Fuel any contract can make its own native asset. On Ethereum, the only native asset is ETH. This allows for much cheaper token transactions because it doesn't require any contract state changes. It also allows you to directly forward any asset in a transaction call, avoiding the need for the `approve` and `transferFrom` mechanisms.

## _Icon Link_ [Optimistic Rollup](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#optimistic-rollup)

An optimistic rollup is a sidechain that uses fraud proofs to verify transactions instead of relying on a majority of validators to be honest.

## _Icon Link_ [Output](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#output)

An output refers to a transaction output, or which UTXOs are output by a transaction.

## _Icon Link_ [Parallel Transactions](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#parallel-transactions)

Parallel transactions refers to the ability of the FuelVM to process multiple transactions in parallel.

## _Icon Link_ [Predicate](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#predicate)

A predicate is a pure function that can return true or false, and is sent inside a transaction as bytecode and checked at transaction validity time. If it evaluates to `false` the transaction will not be processed, and no gas will be used. If it evaluates to `true`, any coins belonging to the address equal to the Merkle root of the predicate bytecode may be spent by the transaction.

## _Icon Link_ [Private Key](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#private-key)

A cryptographic key that is used to prove ownership by producing a digital signature. It should be kept private (or secret) as it can grant access to a wallet.

## _Icon Link_ [Public Key](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#public-key)

A cryptographic key that is generated from its associated private key and can be shared publicly. Addresses are derived from public keys.

## _Icon Link_ [Signature](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#signature)

A cryptographic signature from a wallet, usually in reference to a signature for a message.

## _Icon Link_ [Smart Contract](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#smart-contract)

Also referred to as a contract, a smart contract is a set of programming functions with persistent state that is deployed on a blockchain. Once deployed, the contract code can never be changed or deleted, and anyone can access public functions without permission.

## _Icon Link_ [State Channel](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#state-channel)

State channels allow for users to conduct any number of off-chain transactions while only submitting two on-chain transactions to open and close the channel. This reduces the number of on-chain transactions needed, which reduces the cost and saves time.

## _Icon Link_ [Sway](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#sway)

Sway is the official programming language for Fuel. It is a domain-specific language crafted for the FuelVM and inspired by Rust.

## _Icon Link_ [Testnet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#testnet)

Testnet is short for test network. You can use a testnet to deploy and test contracts for free.

## _Icon Link_ [Toolchain](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#toolchain)

A toolchain is a set of related tools. The Fuel toolchain includes `fuelup`, `forc`, `fuel-core`, and `fuels`.

## _Icon Link_ [Transaction](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#transaction)

A transaction is any interaction with the blockchain, for example sending coins from one address to another.

## _Icon Link_ [Unlocked Wallet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#unlocked-wallet)

An unlocked wallet can interact with both read and write smart contract methods.

## _Icon Link_ [UTXO](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#utxo)

UTXO stands for unspent transaction output.

## _Icon Link_ [UTXO Model](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#utxo-model)

A UTXO model is a blockchain model that doesn't keep track of account balances. Instead, it uses inputs and outputs to manage state, which allows for fast parallel transactions.

## _Icon Link_ [Validator](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#validator)

A validator refers to a network validator or node. Validators help validate transactions and produce blocks.

## _Icon Link_ [Witness](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#witness)

## _Icon Link_ [Zero-Knowledge Proof](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#zero-knowledge-proof)

A method that allows for the verification of secret information without revealing the secret.

## _Icon Link_ [Zero-Knowledge Rollup](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/glossary/\#zero-knowledge-rollup)

A rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions. In ZK rollups, each rollup block posted to the contract must be accompanied by a validity proof (a succinct proof that the block is valid), which is also verified by the contract. Blocks are thus finalized immediately, and withdrawals can be processed in the same Ethereum block.
