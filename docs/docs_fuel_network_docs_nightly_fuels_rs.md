## _Icon Link_ [The Fuel Rust SDK](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-rs/\#the-fuel-rust-sdk)

The Fuel Rust SDK can be used for a variety of things, including:

- Compiling, deploying, and testing [Sway _Icon Link_](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway) contracts
- Using the testnet or running a local Fuel node
- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls
- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract ABI methods

This book is an overview of the different things one can achieve using the Rust SDK, and how to implement them. Keep in mind that both the SDK and the documentation are works-in-progress!
