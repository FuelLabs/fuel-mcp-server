Forc

## _Icon Link_ [Forc Reference](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/forc/\#forc-reference)

Forc stands for Fuel Orchestrator. Forc provides a variety of tools and commands for developers working with the Fuel ecosystem, such as scaffolding a new project, formatting, running scripts, deploying contracts, testing contracts, and more. If you're coming from a Rust background, forc is similar to cargo.

If you are new to Forc, see the [Forc Project _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/forc_project/) introduction section.

For a comprehensive overview of the Forc CLI commands, see the [Commands](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/forc/commands/) section.
