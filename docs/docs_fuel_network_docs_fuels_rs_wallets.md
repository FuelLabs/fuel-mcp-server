Wallets

## _Icon Link_ [Managing wallets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-rs/wallets/\#managing-wallets)

You can use wallets for many important things, for instance:

1. Checking your balance
2. Transferring coins to a destination address or contract
3. Signing messages and transactions
4. Paying for network fees when sending transactions or deploying smart contracts

The SDK gives you many different ways to create and access wallets. Let's explore these different approaches in the following sub-chapters.

> **Note:** Keep in mind that you should never share your private/secret key. And in the case of wallets that were derived from a mnemonic phrase, never share your mnemonic phrase. If you're planning on storing the wallet on disk, do not store the plain private/secret key and do not store the plain mnemonic phrase. Instead, use `Wallet::encrypt` to encrypt its content first before saving it to disk.
