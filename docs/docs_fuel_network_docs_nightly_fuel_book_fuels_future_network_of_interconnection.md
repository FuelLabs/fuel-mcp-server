Network of Interconnection

## _Icon Link_ [A Network of Interconnected L2s & L3s](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuel-book/fuels-future/network-of-interconnection/\#a-network-of-interconnected-l2s--l3s)

Fuel Ignition is the beach-head network, introducing the Fuel technology to the world. However, as the technology matures and the ecosystem grows, this technology will be used to power a growing ecosystem of modular rollups. Developers choose to launch independent chains either to customize the stack, to capture economic value, or simply to build an independent ecosystem for community building.

Fuel’s technology already enables the fastest execution and lowest fees, and future development will ensure these chains can easily interoperate with other chains throughout the ecosystem. Fuel’s light-clients, shared sequencer, combined with the SNAP finality gadget (described below) allow these chains to reduce their friction.
