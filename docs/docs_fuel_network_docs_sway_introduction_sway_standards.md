Sway Standards

## _Icon Link_ [Sway Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#sway-standards)

Just like many other smart contract languages, usage standards have been developed to enable cross compatibility between smart contracts.

For more information on using a Sway Standard, please refer to the [Sway-Standards Repository _Icon Link_](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards).

## _Icon Link_ [Native Asset Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#native-asset-standards)

- [SRC-20; Native Asset Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-20-native-asset/) defines the implementation of a standard API for [Native Assets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets/) using the Sway Language.
- [SRC-3; Mint and Burn](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-3-minting-and-burning/) is used to enable mint and burn functionality for Native Assets.
- [SRC-7; Arbitrary Asset Metadata Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-7-asset-metadata/) is used to store metadata for [Native Assets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets/), usually as NFTs.
- [SRC-9; Metadata Keys Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-9-metadata-keys/) is used to store standardized metadata keys for [Native Assets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets/) in combination with the SRC-7 standard.
- [SRC-6; Vault Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-6-vault/) defines the implementation of a standard API for asset vaults developed in Sway.

## _Icon Link_ [Predicate Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#predicate-standards)

- [SRC-13; Soulbound Address Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-13-soulbound-address/) defines a specific `Address` as a Soulbound Address for Soulbound Assets to become non-transferable.

## _Icon Link_ [Access Control Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#access-control-standards)

- [SRC-5; Ownership Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-5-ownership/) is used to restrict function calls to admin users in contracts.

## _Icon Link_ [Contract Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#contract-standards)

- [SRC-12; Contract Factory](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-12-contract-factory/) defines the implementation of a standard API for contract factories.

## _Icon Link_ [Bridge Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#bridge-standards)

- [SRC-8; Bridged Asset](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-8-bridged-asset/) defines the metadata required for an asset bridged to the Fuel Network.
- [SRC-10; Native Bridge Standard](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-10-native-bridge/) defines the standard API for the Native Bridge between the Fuel Chain and the canonical base chain.

## _Icon Link_ [Documentation Standards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#documentation-standards)

- [SRC-2; Inline Documentation](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway-standards/src-2-inline-documentation/) defines how to document your Sway files.

## _Icon Link_ [Standards Support](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/introduction/sway_standards/\#standards-support)

Libraries have also been developed to support Sway Standards. These can be in [Sway-Libs](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/reference/sway_libs/).
