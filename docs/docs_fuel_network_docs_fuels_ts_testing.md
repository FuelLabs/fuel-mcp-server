## _Icon Link_ [Testing](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/testing/\#testing)

This guide will teach you how to test Sway applications using the Typescript SDK.

While we use [Vitest _Icon Link_](https://vitest.dev/) internally, we don't enforce any specific testing library or framework, so you can pick whichever you feel comfortable with.
