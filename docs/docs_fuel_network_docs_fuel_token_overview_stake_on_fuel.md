## _Icon Link_ [How to Stake on Fuel](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuel-token-overview/stake-on-fuel/\#how-to-stake-on-fuel)

Please visit [app.fuel.network/staking/on-fuel _Icon Link_](https://app.fuel.network/staking/on-fuel) to stake your tokens on the Fuel Shared Sequencer Network through Fuel Ignition. Below, you'll find a helpful guide to get started.

## _Icon Link_ [Connect Fuel Wallet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuel-token-overview/stake-on-fuel/\#connect-fuel-wallet)

Start by connecting a Fuel wallet with FUEL tokens. This includes both non-native EVM and SVM wallets.

## _Icon Link_ [Stake](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuel-token-overview/stake-on-fuel/\#stake)

From left to right, you can view your FUEL token balance in your Fuel wallet, your staked FUEL token balance on the shared sequencer network, and your accumulated rewards.

Press the "Stake" button next to your balance to begin the staking process.

Enter the number of tokens you wish to delegate to the validators. Then, click the "Deposit" button to stake your tokens.

Please note: unlike staking on mainnet Ethereum, the validator delegation process is automatically assigned, so you donâ€™t need to manage each validator manually.

After successfully depositing, your total staked token balance will update. The dashboard below will display the distribution of your delegated tokens. In the example diagram, the tokens are distributed evenly among the validators.

## _Icon Link_ [Withdraw](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuel-token-overview/stake-on-fuel/\#withdraw)

Withdrawing from the shared sequencer network is as simple as staking. Click the "Withdraw" button beside the amount of tokens you have staked.

Your undelegated token balance will return to your Fuel wallet, and the validator dashboard will update accordingly as well.

## _Icon Link_ [Claim Rewards](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuel-token-overview/stake-on-fuel/\#claim-rewards)

Once you have staked your FUEL tokens, you will start to accumulate FUEL rewards. Click "Claim" next to your earned rewards balance to collect your tokens.
