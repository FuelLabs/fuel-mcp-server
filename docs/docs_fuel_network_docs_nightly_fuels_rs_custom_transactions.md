Custom Transactions

## _Icon Link_ [Custom transactions](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-rs/custom-transactions/\#custom-transactions)

However, sometimes we must make custom transactions with specific inputs, outputs, witnesses, etc. In the next chapter, we will show how to use the Rust SDKs transaction builders to accomplish this.
