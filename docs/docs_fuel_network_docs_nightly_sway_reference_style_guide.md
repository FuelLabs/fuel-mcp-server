## _Icon Link_ [Capitalization](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/sway/reference/style_guide/\#capitalization)

In Sway, structs, traits, and enums are `CapitalCase`. Modules, variables, and functions are `snake_case`, constants are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. The compiler will warn you if your capitalization is ever unidiomatic.
