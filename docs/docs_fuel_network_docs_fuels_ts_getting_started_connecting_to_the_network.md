Connecting to the Network

## _Icon Link_ [Connecting to the Network](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/getting-started/connecting-to-the-network/\#connecting-to-the-network)

After [installing](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/getting-started/installation/) the `fuels` package, it's easy to connect to the Network:

```fuel_Box fuel_Box-idXKMmm-css
import { Provider } from 'fuels';

const NETWORK_URL = 'https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql';

const provider = new Provider(NETWORK_URL);

const baseAssetId = await provider.getBaseAssetId();
const chainId = await provider.getChainId();
const gasConfig = await provider.getGasConfig();

console.log('chainId', chainId);
console.log('baseAssetId', baseAssetId);
console.log('gasConfig', gasConfig);
```
