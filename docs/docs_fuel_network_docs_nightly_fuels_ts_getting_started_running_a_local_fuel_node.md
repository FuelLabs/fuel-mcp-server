Running a Local Fuel Node

## _Icon Link_ [Running a local Fuel node](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/getting-started/running-a-local-fuel-node/\#running-a-local-fuel-node)

Remember to first install the [Fuel Toolchain _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/).

Check the online docs:

|  | Command | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fuel Binary | `fuel-core` | [docs _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/node-operator/fuel-ignition/local-node/) — Running a local node |
| TS SDK | `fuels node` | [docs _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/fuels-cli/commands/#fuels-node) — Using the `fuels` CLI |

## _Icon Link_ [Testing](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/getting-started/running-a-local-fuel-node/\#testing)

You can run a Fuel node from within your `.ts` unit tests:

- [Launching a test node](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/testing/launching-a-test-node/)

## _Icon Link_ [Developing](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/getting-started/running-a-local-fuel-node/\#developing)

Configure your project for the `fuels` CLI using a `fuels.config.ts` file:

- [Using the `fuels init` command](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/fuels-cli/commands/#fuels-init)

It makes development easier with a hot-reload experience:

- [Using the `fuels dev` command](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/nightly/fuels-ts/fuels-cli/commands/#fuels-dev)
