## _Icon Link_ [The Fuel TypeScript SDK](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/\#the-fuel-typescript-sdk)

The Fuel TypeScript SDK provides methods and utilities in TypeScript, for developing on or interacting with the Fuel network and its [ecosystem _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/intro/what-is-fuel/).

Using the SDK you can:

- Deploy, interact with, and test [Sway _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/) contracts.
- Bootstrap a dApp and local development environment using the [create fuels CLI _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/creating-a-fuel-dapp/).
- Generate and import wallets from private key, mnemonic, or JSON and safely store them on the client.
- Craft custom transactions and mutate them by adding resources, policies and signers and submit them.
- Generate types for [Sway programs _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/sway-program-types/) using [typegen _Icon Link_](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/fuels-cli/abi-typegen/) to give end-to-end type safety.
